# Overview
In the pandemic situation, it has become tough for the academic institutes across the world to take classes and online labs.

So, with the aim of making it simpler to deploy virtual labs, I have decided to make a few Boot-scripts for the purpose.

The labs can be easily deployed using AWS. Institutes should have AWS educate affiliation for this purpose.
